#  Neymar Jr. and Co. Look to Win Another French Cup Title

The French Cup is the annual knockout football cup competition in France. The cup is open to all clubs in French football, from Ligue 1 down to the Championnat National. The cup was first played in 1917. The most successful club in the cup is Paris Saint-Germain with 10 titles, followed by Girondins de Bordeaux with 5 titles.

Neymar Jr. and his teammates at Paris Saint-Germain will be looking to win their second consecutive French Cup title when they take on AS Monaco in the final on April 21, 2019. Neymar and company were dominant in the competition this year, winning all six of their matches en route to the final.

AS Monaco will be a tough opponent for PSG, as they are one of the best teams in France this year. However, if Neymar and company continue to play like they have so far this season, they should be able to come out victorious and add another trophy to their collection.

#  Neymar Jr. Scores in PSG's 2-1 Victory Over Roma

In the 59th minute, Neymar Jr. scored his second goal of the night to give Paris Saint-Germain a 2-1 lead over Roma in their International Champions Cup match at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis.

The Brazil international showed off his usual array of tricks and flicks before firing home a low right-footed shot from just outside the penalty area. The goal was Neymar's 51st for PSG since signing from Barcelona for a world record fee of €222 million in August 2017.

Earlier, he had set up Kylian Mbappe for the opening goal with a defence-splitting pass in the first half.

"It was a good game," Neymar said after the match. "We played well and it's always good to score goals."

PSG coach Thomas Tuchel was also pleased with Neymar's performance. "He has started very well," Tuchel said. "He is physically and mentally ready."

Neymar is expected to make his competitive debut for PSG when they begin their Ligue 1 campaign against Caen on August 10.

#  Kylian Mbappé Scoring Sensation Continues in Champions League

In a Champions League match against A.S. Monaco on Wednesday, Kylian Mbappé became the youngest player ever to score in the UEFA Champions League.

The 18-year-old forward’s goal in the 57th minute was pivotal as his club, Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), won 3-1. This continues an amazing run for Mbappé, who has been scoring goals at an astonishing rate all year long.

Mbappé began his career playing youth soccer for Cannes. In 2013, he joined AS Monaco’s academy, and quickly rose through the ranks. He made his professional debut in February 2016 at age 17 and scored in his second match.

Mbappé helped lead AS Monaco to the French league championship and then signed with PSG this summer for a transfer fee of €180 million (about $213 million), making him the most expensive teenager in history.

He has continued to perform well for PSG, netting 13 goals in all competitions so far this season. With Wednesday’s goal in the Champions League, Mbappé now has 14 goals in just 19 games played this year.

Many experts are already calling him one of the best young players in the world and predicting that he will become one of the greatest players of all time. His coach at PSG, Unai Emery, said after Wednesday’s game: “He is always very focused on helping the team win and today he scored an important goal for us. He is still learning and developing but he is already one of the best attackers in Europe.”

Mbappé is not only a great scorer but also a tremendous dribbler and playmaker. Even at such a young age, he has demonstrated his ability to take on defenders one-on-one and create chances for teammates.


Kylian Mbappé was born on December 20th, 1998, in Bondy, France. He started playing soccer at a young age and soon showed remarkable talent as a striker.

#  Could One of These PSG Stars Be Headed to the Premier League?

The Premier League is one of the most popular leagues in the world, and teams are always looking to strengthen their squads with the best players possible. One team that has been linked with some big-name transfers in recent weeks is Paris Saint-Germain.

The French champions have dominated Ligue 1 in recent years, but they could be about to lose some of their biggest stars. Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Edinson Cavani are all reportedly targets for Real Madrid, and if they were to leave, PSG would need to bring in some new talent.

So which PSG stars could be moving to the Premier League this summer? Let's take a look:

1. Neymar

It's no secret that Real Madrid are interested in Neymar, and if he were to move to the Bernabeu, it would be a huge blow to PSG. The Brazilian superstar has been one of the best players in the world over the past few years, and he would be a huge addition to any Premier League team.

2. Kylian Mbappe

Mbappe is another player who has been linked with a move to Real Madrid, and he would be an equally devastating loss for PSG. The 20-year-old has already established himself as one of the best young players in the world, and he would be a great signing for any Premier League side.

3. Edinson Cavani

Cavani is another PSG star who could be on his way out of Paris this summer. The Uruguayan striker has been linked with moves to both Chelsea and Manchester United, and he would be a great addition to either team. Cavani is a proven goalscorer in Europe's top leagues, and he would be sure to make an impact in the Premier League.

#  Kylian Mbappé Wins Second Golden Boy Award

Premier League club Paris Saint-Germain’s French forward Kylian Mbappé has won his second Golden Boy award, dethroning Liverpool’s English midfielder of Egyptian descent Mohamed Salah. The prestigious award is handed out to the best under-21 player in Europe by journalists from around the continent.

Mbappé, who turns 20 on December 20, was the clear favourite for the award this year after a scintillating season which saw him score 33 goals in all competitions for PSG and win the Ligue 1 title. He also helped France reach the World Cup final, where they narrowly lost to Croatia.

Previous winners of the Golden Boy award include Paulo Dybala, Raheem Sterling and Lionel Messi.
