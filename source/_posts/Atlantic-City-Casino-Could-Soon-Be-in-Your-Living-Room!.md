#  Atlantic City Casino Could Soon Be in Your Living Room!

 Atlantic City officials are considering a proposal that would allow casinos to offer virtual reality gambling. This new technology would allow players to gamble from the comfort of their own homes.

The proposal was put forth by the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement. The division is asking casino operators to submit proposals for how they would use virtual reality gaming.

Division officials say that the technology could be used to attract new players, and could also help keep existing players interested in gambling.

Gaming industry experts say that the use of virtual reality could revolutionize the gaming industry. They say that it will allow casinos to offer a wider variety of games, and will also make gambling more interactive and engaging.

At this point, it is not clear how much money casino operators would be willing to invest in virtual reality gaming. However, it is expected that they will be willing to spend significant sums in order to stay competitive in the industry.

Some industry observers are skeptical about the potential for virtual reality gaming. They note that there have been other technological innovations that have failed to catch on with casino players.

#  New Jersey to Vote on Internet Gambling Bill

On Monday, New Jersey lawmakers decided to put the issue of legalizing online gambling to a vote on November 25th. The proposed bill, which was first introduced in February, would allow for Atlantic City casinos to offer internet gambling services to people within New Jersey’s borders.

Casino executives have been eager to push the legislation forward, as they believe that internet gambling could help revive the flagging casino industry in Atlantic City. However, some lawmakers have expressed concerns that the bill does not do enough to protect consumers from potential scams and fraud.

If the bill is passed, it will become the second state in the US to legalize online gambling (after Nevada). It is estimated that the online gambling market could be worth as much as $10 billion per year, so there is a lot of money at stake.

#  Nevada Legalizes Internet Gambling

After a long and heated debate, the Nevada state legislature has voted to legalize internet gambling.

The new law allows Nevada residents over the age of 21 to gamble online using their computers or mobile devices. The legislation also authorizes the state's casinos to offer online gaming services to customers outside of Nevada.

Supporters of the bill say that it will create thousands of new jobs in the state and generate millions of dollars in revenue. They argue that the technology is already in place and that there is no reason for Nevada not to take advantage of it.

Opponents of the bill say that it is too risky and could lead to addiction and other problems. They also argue that it will put Nevada's casinos at a disadvantage compared to those in other states that have not legalized internet gambling.

#  Delaware Authorizes Online Gambling

On July 31, 2018, Delaware Governor John Carney signed into law a bill that allows for online gambling within the state. The bill had been unanimously passed by both chambers of the Delaware General Assembly. The new law will allow people in Delaware to gamble on games such as poker, blackjack, and slots over the internet.

Delaware is not the first state to legalize online gambling. In 2013, New Jersey became the first state to do so. Since then, a number of other states have followed suit, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Nevada.

There are a number of reasons why states are legalizing online gambling. For one thing, it allows states to generate additional revenue from taxes on gambling activity. It can also help to boost tourism, as people from outside of the state can visit authorized websites and gamble from the comfort of their own homes. Finally, it can help to create jobs in the gambling industry.

Online gambling is not without its opponents, however. Some people argue that it can lead to addiction and other negative consequences. Others worry that it will be used by criminals and hackers to steal money from players.

Despite these concerns, most experts believe that online gambling is here to stay. As more and more states legalize it, the likelihood that federal laws will change to permit nationwide online gambling grows larger. So far, only Congress has the power to legalize nationwide online gambling, but there is growing bipartisan support for doing so.

#  California legalizes online gambling

On September 20, 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown signed into law Assembly Bill 1463 (AB 1463), which legalizes online gambling within the state. The new law goes into effect on January 1, 2019.

AB 1463 authorizes the state’s 55 Indian tribes to offer online poker, blackjack, and other casino games to players located within California’s borders. The bill also allows for the establishment of licensed and regulated online gambling websites that will be available to all Californians over the age of 21.

Governor Brown stated that “this bill will make it easier for California to regulate Internet gambling and ensure that minors are not gambling online. It also allows California to negotiate better gaming compacts with tribes and share in more of the revenue generated by tribal casinos.”

Assemblyman Adam Gray, who introduced AB 1463, said that the new law will “bring thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in new economic activity to our state.” He added that it will also allow California “to keep up with other states that have already legalized online gambling, such as Nevada and New Jersey.”

Online gambling is big business in the United States. In 2017, American gamblers spent a total of $40.65 billion on internet casino games, poker, and sports betting, according to research firm Statista. This figure is expected to grow to $52.5 billion by 2020.

The passage of AB 1463 represents a major victory for the gaming industry in California. The state’s Indian tribes have been pushing for legalization for many years, and they are expected to dominate the newly-legalized market. Several large operators, including MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment, are already gearing up to offer their services in California once the law goes into effect next year.
