#  Neymar and Co. Strike it Lucky with PSG Slot Machine!

Neymar and his fellow PSG attackers hit the jackpot this weekend, scoring all 3 goals in a 3-0 win over Lille OSC. Neymar’s opener came from the penalty spot after he was brought down in the box. The Brazilian superstar then added his 2nd goal midway through the 2nd half, before Edinson Cavani put the icing on the cake in injury time.

Despite criticisms that they are too reliant on Neymar, PSG’s attacking trio of Neymar, Cavani and Kylian Mbappe looked deadly against Lille. This was Mbappe’s 1st start for PSG since completing his big-money move from AS Monaco in the summer. The 19-year-old winger looked lively throughout and will be looking to add to his tally of 5 goals in all competitions this season.

PSG have now won their last 5 matches in all competitions, scoring 17 goals in the process. They will be hoping to continue this good run of form as they prepare for their next match against Montpellier HSC.

With Neymar, Cavani and Mbappe all firing on all cylinders, PSG look like a formidable force going into the latter stages of the season. If they can keep up this goal scoring form, they will be sure to put pressure on reigning champions Monaco for the Ligue 1 title.
