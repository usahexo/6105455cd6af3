#  How to Get a Legendary Gun Out of Borderlands 2 Roulette

Borderlands 2 features a slot machine-like game called roulette that gives players the chance to win rare and legendary weapons. However, there is no surefire way to get a specific weapon out of the roulette, leaving many gamers frustrated. This article will provide tips on how to increase your chances of obtaining the Legendary gun you desire from Borderlands 2 roulette.

The first step is to understand what goes into the roulette machine. There are three spinning wheels, each with different symbols. The first wheel has various weapon types such as pistols, shotguns, and assault rifles. The second wheel has rarity levels from common to very rare. The last wheel has manufacturer names such as Jakobs and Vladof. If the three symbols on the wheels line up, you will win the corresponding weapon.

There are several ways to increase your chances of winning at Borderlands 2 roulette. One is to increase your luck by using items such as eridium bars or cash bonuses from Moxxi’s bar in Sanctuary. You can also try saving your game before playing roulette, reloading if you don’t win the weapon you want. Another method is to purchase purple or orange weapons from vendors and then use those weapons in the roulette. Weapons of these colors are more likely to generate better results in the roulette than common or rare weapons.

Finally, it is important to know which weapons are available in the roulette so you can make an informed decision when betting. You can find a list of all available Legendary weapons online, or check out this summary:
1) Rocket launchers – The Equalizer, Torid
2) Sniper rifles – Skullmasher, Volcano
3) Pistols – Thanatos
4) Assault rifles – The Slagga

In mathematics, probability is the study of random phenomena. In the game of roulette, it is possible to influence the probability of an event by using various manipulations.

Players can use different techniques when playing roulette in order to improve their chances of winning. One such technique is called The Martingale System which is a betting system where a player doubles their bet after every loss.

This system can be used in conjunction with other strategies, like the cover-betting strategy, which is when a player bets on two outside bets that together make up a third bet. This will help to minimise losses if one of the bets loses.

Another strategy that can be used when playing roulette is known as the James Bond strategy. In this strategy, players only bet on high numbers (19-36). This strategy is thought to be more advantageous because the odds of winning are increased. When coupled with the Martingale System, this can be a very effective way to win at roulette. 

Players should also utilise betting patterns in order to increase their chances of winning. These patterns can be found online or in books about gambling and casino games. By using these patterns, players can place their bets accordingly and improve their chances of winning at roulette.

Although it is not possible to guarantee a victory when playing roulette, using these strategies will give players a better chance of winning than if they were to simply guess where the ball would land. So next time you're feeling lucky, why not give one of these strategies a try?

There are a few ways to get a legendary gun from the slot machine in Borderlands 2. One way is to save and quit your game before you spin the slot machine, reload your game, and if you don't get the gun you want, just quit again without saving. This will put you back at the slot machine with another try. You can also use this glitch to get higher level weapons and other items from the slot machines.

Another way to get a legendary gun from the slot machine is to save your game, then load it up again while you're in Sanctuary (the town in Borderlands 2). This will reset the slot machines so that they have new items. Finally, you can also use this technique to get other loot as well, such as rare guns and shields.

#  Getting a legendary weapon from Borderlands 2 roulette- it can be done!

Borderlands 2 is an immensely popular game- its combination of FPS action and RPG mechanics make it a blast to play. The endgame can be especially rewarding, as powerful legendary weapons await players who reach the top levels. But how do you get these weapons?

Some players resort to buying them through online stores or trading with others, but there is another way- getting them through the game's roulette wheel. This process can be risky, but it can also be very rewarding if done correctly. In this article, we'll walk you through the process of getting a legendary weapon from Borderlands 2 roulette.

First, you need to understand the odds involved. The roulette in Borderlands 2 has a few different types of rewards: rare items, unique items, and legendary weapons. The chances of getting a legendary weapon are about 0.5%, so it's definitely not going to be easy. However, if you're willing to put in the time and effort, it can be well worth it!

To start out, you'll need to gather as much money as possible. The more money you have, the better your chances of winning a legendary weapon will be. To increase your chances even further, you can also purchase some randomized loot packs from the game's store. These packs will give you additional rewards when used at specific points in the roulette wheel- including some that may increase your chances of getting a legendary weapon!

Once you've got your money ready, it's time to start spinning the roulette wheel. There are a few different spots on the wheel that are key for getting a legendary weapon- we'll outline them below. Remember though that there is no guarantee that following these steps will result in success- but they definitely increase your chances!

The first spot is right near the beginning of the roulette wheel, and features two golden pistols facing each other. This is one of the best spots to get a legendary weapon from Borderlands 2 roulette, as it offers several different potential rewards including legendaries and unique items. If this is the spot that your ball falls into, congratulations! You've just won yourself a powerful new weapon.

The next spot on our list is at the very end of the roulette wheel, and offers up four golden guns surrounding a large central diamond. If your ball falls into this spot, then congratulations! You've just won yourself an incredibly rare Unique Weapon from Borderlands 2 Roulette! While not quite as good as a Legendary Weapon, these Unique Weapons offer some very powerful bonuses and stats that can help you take down enemies even faster.

Finally, we come to our last spot- one that offers up three potential rewards including Legendary Weapons and Unique Weapons alike. This spot is located right in between the two spots mentioned earlier, and is definitely worth trying if those previous two haven't yielded any results for you yet. simply spin until your ball lands in this space and see what comes up- it could be anything from a common weapon all the way up to a Legendary Weapon!

#  So you want to get a legendary weapon from Borderlands 2 roulette- here's how!

Borderlands 2 roulette can be a great way to get ahold of some of the best weapons in the game- but it can also be frustrating if you don't know what you're doing. In this guide, I'm going to walk you through the process of getting a legendary weapon from Borderlands 2 roulette.

First things first: you're going to need some Eridium. The amount you'll need depends on the weapon you're trying to get, but generally speaking, you'll want around 4-5 Eridium bars. You can trade in lower rarity weapons for Eridium at any vending machine in the game, or simply sell them off for cash.

Once you have your Eridium, it's time to head to The Forge in Sanctuary. Talk to Tiny Tina and select "Roulette" from the menu. From there, choose the "Permanent Weapons" option and put your Eridium into the machine.

Now comes the tricky part: choosing your weapon. There are a lot of legendary weapons in Borderlands 2, and it can be tough to decide which one to go for. My advice? Look at the weapon stats and decide which one is best suited for your playstyle. If you're not sure what to look for, check out online resources like [this](http://borderlands2.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons) one that list all of the Borderlands 2 legendary weapons and their stats.

Once you've chosen your weapon, it's time to start spinning the roulette wheel! Keep spinning until you finally land on your chosen weapon. If you're lucky, you'll get it on your first try. But more often than not, you'll probably have to spin several times before finally landing on your prize.

That's basically all there is to it! So go forth and get yourself that sweet legendary weapon from Borderlands 2 roulette!
