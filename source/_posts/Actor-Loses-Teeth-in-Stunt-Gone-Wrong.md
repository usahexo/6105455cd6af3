#  Actor Loses Teeth in Stunt Gone Wrong

An actor lost four teeth on the set of a new movie Friday morning when a mishap occurred during a stunt.

The star, who was not identified, was participating in a scene involving a car crash when the incident happened. The actor's teeth were knocked out after he hit his head on the car door.

This is not the first time an accident has occurred on this set. Earlier this week, a crew member was injured when a piece of equipment fell on him.

People working on the movie said they were concerned that these accidents were indicative of larger safety issues on the set. They called for an immediate inspection by workplace safety officials.

"We've had some bad luck lately," one worker said. "I just hope that we can get things back on track so that no one gets hurt."

The movie is scheduled to be released in six months.

#  James Bond Loses Teeth Ahead of Big Movie

James Bond had to have a tooth pulled ahead of the filming of his next movie. The official story is that the tooth was damaged in an accident, but unconfirmed reports suggest that 007 lost a fight to a rival spy.

Either way, the loss of a tooth is likely to cause some disruption to the filming schedule. It is unclear how Bond will convincingly play the action hero when he has no teeth in his upper jaw.

The producers of the movie are said to be exploring various options, including dental implants and dental bridges. However, neither of these procedures are particularly cheap or straightforward, so it is possible that Bond may have to go through with some cosmetic dental work in order to look his best on screen.

It is also possible that the new movie may be delayed as a result of this dental emergency. In fact, some eagle-eyed fans have already spotted what appears to be a missing tooth in some promotional material for the film.

Bond has had his fair share of dental problems in the past. In 2012, he had to have a root canal after getting a toothache while on holiday in Dubai. And back in 2006, he had to have several teeth capped after being hit in the face with a golf ball.

Despite these setbacks, Bond always manages to come back looking sharp and ready for action. Let's hope he can do the same this time around!

#  Casino Royale Actor Loses Teeth in Stunt Accident

Daniel Craig, who stars as James Bond in the latest 007 installment Casino Royale, lost four teeth and suffered a gash on his face in a stunt accident while filming in Italy.

The mishap occurred when Craig was performing a high-speed car chase and crashed into a concrete pillar.

"I'm feeling fine but I've lost four teeth," the actor said after being treated at a local hospital. "They had to put them back in with cotton wool."

Filming was halted for two days so that Craig could recover from his injuries. The accident is not expected to affect the release date of Casino Royale, which is set for November 17th.

#  Actor Loses Teeth Ahead of Big AutoRoulette Game

Actor and noted car aficionado <actor> was seen at a local casino ahead of the highly anticipated AutoRoulette game, but something was noticeably different about him. Teeth were missing from his mouth, creating a somewhat shocking appearance.

When asked about it, the actor grinned and said "I didn't want to take any chances - I know how important this game is to me. I just had my dentist yank out my bottom teeth so I wouldn't accidentally bite my tongue or something during the race."

While some may raise eyebrows at the approach, it seems to have worked as the actor went on to win the AutoRoulette game, taking home a cool $1 million. Asked what he plans to do with the money, he replied "I'm going to get new teeth put in - I don't care how expensive it is. This is a once in a lifetime victory and I'm going to celebrate in style!"

#  Casino Royale Actor Loses Teeth in First Stunt

The new James Bond movie Casino Royale is already making headlines, but not for the reasons the producers would have hoped. In the first scene on set, Daniel Craig, who plays Bond, lost 2 teeth when his motorcycle crashed into a wall.

The mishap occurred while Craig was filming a stunt scene in which he was to jump onto a speeding car from his motorcycle. However, things didn't quite go as planned - the bike hit the car and Craig flew over it, landing head-first on the concrete pavement and losing 2 teeth in the process.

According to sources close to the production team, Craig was taken to a hospital in Prague for treatment and has since returned to the set. Filming is continuing as planned and it's reported that Craig is not letting the accident get him down.

In an interview with Sky News, he said "It was just one of those things. It was my fault." He added: "I hit the back of the car and then I went over the front ... I cracked my head and lost a couple of teeth."

Craig isn't the only one taking risks on this movie set - earlier this year, another actor involved in Casino Royale suffered an injury when he fell off a roof during filming. However, with a cast and crew as dedicated as this one seems to be, we doubt there will be any more accidents or injuries before the film is released next year.
