#  How to have a casino marker 5 Boxing Game that will keep you entertained for hours!

Casino marker games are all the rage and for good reason. They’re fun, exciting, and can keep you entertained for hours on end. Here is how to make your own casino marker game that will be sure to keep you entertained.

First, you will need to gather some supplies. For this game, you will need a deck of cards, two different colors of poker chips (or any other type of small tokens), a pen or pencil, and paper.

Stack the cards in the middle of the playing area. Shuffle them and divide them into two piles, one with 26 cards and one with 24 cards. Turn over the top card of each pile to start the two separate decks. These are your markers.

The player to the left of the dealer starts the game. On their turn they draw one card from either deck and play one. The Ace is high and the Two is low. The 4 suits are Hearts Clubs Spades Diamonds . Winning hands are as follows:

One Pair – Two cards of the same rank (e.g., two Aces)

Two Pairs – Two different pairs (e.g., two Kings and two Queens)

Three of a Kind – Three cards of the same rank (e.g., three 7s)

Straight – Five consecutive cards of any suit (e.g., 5-6-7-8-9)


Four of a Kind – Four cards of the same rank (e.g., four Jacks)

Full House – Three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank (e.g., three 7s and two 2s)

Flush – Five cards all in the same suit (e.g., all hearts) 

Straight Flush – Five consecutive cards all in the same suit (e g five spades). This is the highest hand possible!

If both players have identical hands, then both players automatically lose (this includes ties). The first player to run out of cards loses the game. To keep track of who is winning and losing, use poker chips or some other small tokens as markers on a piece of paper recording each player’s name at each round played .Below are some additional variants that can make this game more interesting:

 Joker Wild: In addition to using a regular deck of 52 playing cards, include 1 joker in the deck . If this card is turned over then it can be used as any other card in the deck . So if someone is playing with 4 jacks showing and turn over another jack, they now have 5 jacks which would give them a winning hand . If 2 jokers are turned over then both players automatically lose as there can be no winner with so many wildcards in play! 

Deuces Wild: Similar to Joker Wild but instead use 2 deuces as wildcards . 

Double Down: After looking at their first 3 drawn cards , if a player feels they have a good chance at winning they may choose to 'double down' - this means they will receive only 1 more card but it must be counted towards their final hand . If they subsequently win they get double their original bet back plus whatever else was won during that round; however if they lose then they forfeit not only their original bet but also everything else that was won during that round!
