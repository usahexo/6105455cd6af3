#  Is 777 Blackjack The Best Game To Play At DraftKings Casino?

When it comes to casino games, blackjack is one of the most popular ones around. And it’s no wonder why – the game is simple to learn but can be played in a variety of ways, making it perfect for all kinds of players. So if you’re looking for a game to play at DraftKings Casino, blackjack should definitely be at the top of your list.

But with so many different blackjack variants available, it can be tough to decide which one to play. If you’re new to the game, we recommend starting with classic blackjack. This version is played with just two decks of cards and offers relatively low stakes, making it perfect for beginners.

If you’re looking for something a bit more challenging, however, then we recommend trying out progressive blackjack. This variant features higher stakes and allows players to win massive payouts if they hit a royal flush.

Of course, if you’re looking for something a bit more casual then we recommend playing Spanish 21 instead. This version of blackjack uses six decks of cards instead of two, and features unique rules that make the game much more exciting than traditional blackjack.

So whichever variant of blackjack you choose to play, we guarantee that you’ll have a great time at DraftKings Casino. So what are you waiting for? Start playing today!
