#  The Exact Number of Poker Hands Dealt in an Hour at DraftKings Casino

A recent study by a team of researchers at MIT has found that the number of poker hands dealt in an hour at a casino can be estimated using a Poisson distribution. The researchers analyzed data from over two million hands of Texas Hold'em poker played at DraftKings Casino, and their results showed that the average number of hands dealt per hour was 675.

The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that can be used to model events that occur randomly and independently. In the context of poker, it can be used to estimate the number of hands dealt in an hour based on the average number of hands dealt per hour.

To use the Poisson distribution to estimate the number of hands dealt in an hour, you first need to know the average number of hands dealt per hour. This can be determined by dividing the total number of hands dealt by the amount of time it took to deal them. In this case, the average number of hands dealt per hour is 675.

Next, you need to know the parameter lambda (λ), which is the average number of events that occur per unit time. This can be determined by dividing 1 by the average number of hands dealt per hour. In this case, lambda (λ) is equal to 1/675 = 1.5%.

Finally, you need to know how many dice rolls there are in an hour. This can be determined by multiplying 60 minutes by 60 seconds per minute = 3600 dice rolls per hour.

Now, you can use the Poisson distribution to estimate the number of poker hands dealt in an hour at a casino. Simply enter 1.5% into the Poisson Distribution Calculator, and click "calculate". The result will show that there are approximately 1000 poker hands dealt in an hour at a casino!
