#  Mississippi Joins Growing List of States to Offer Gambling Online

In a move that is sure to appease both state coffers and casino operators, Mississippi has announced it will join the growing list of states to offer gambling online. The new regulation, which goes into effect on July 1st, will allow residents of the state to gamble on casino games, poker, and sports betting from their homes or mobile devices.

Governor Phil Bryant heralded the move as a major victory for the state, noting that it would bring in much-needed revenue while creating jobs in the casino industry. He also praised the work of the legislature in crafting a bill that he said would be "enacted in a responsible manner."

Opponents of online gambling have raised concerns about its potential for addiction and other social ills, but supporters argue that such dangers already exist with brick-and-mortar casinos. They maintain that if done responsibly, online gambling can be a safe and fun way to enjoy some entertainment and possibly win some money.

Mississippi is not the only state moving forward with online gambling; according to recent reports, at least 10 others are considering similar legislation. This increase in interest can likely be attributed to the success of states like New Jersey, which has seen significant revenue growth since launching its online gambling program in 2013.

If you're looking to get in on the action, here are some tips for finding reputable sites where you can gamble online:

- Look for sites that are licensed and regulated by respected gaming authorities.

- Make sure the site has a history of honoring payouts.

- Avoid sites that are known for spamming or scams.

- Read customer reviews to get an idea of what others have experienced with the site.

#  Nevada Gets in on the Action, Opens Up Online Gambling

 Nevada has always been on the forefront of gambling and gaming. It was the home of Las Vegas and continues to be one of the most popular tourist destinations in the United States. So it's no surprise that Nevada is also one of the first states to legalize online gambling.

Residents of Nevada have been able to gamble online since 2013, when Governor Brian Sandoval signed a bill into law legalizing internet poker and other forms of casino games. The law went into effect in March of that year, and Nevada became the first state in the country to offer legal online gambling.

The passage of the bill was seen as a major victory for the gambling industry, which had been lobbying for years for legalization of online gambling. Supporters of online gaming argued that it would help revive the struggling casino industry and create jobs.

Nevada's online gambling industry has grown rapidly since its inception. In 2014, gross gaming revenue from online poker and casinos totaled $274 million, up from $266 million in 2013. And those numbers are expected to continue to grow, as more people switch to playing casino games online instead of going to live casinos.

There are now dozens of licensed sites offering online gambling in Nevada, including Caesars Entertainment, Golden Nugget, and Wynn Resorts. Players can choose from a variety of games, including poker, blackjack, roulette, and slots.

One downside to Nevada's online gambling industry is that it is closed to players outside the state. That means players living in other states can't participate in legal Nevada gaming sites. However, that could soon change.

A federal bill introduced last year would legalize online gambling nationwide, allowing players from all 50 states to participate in regulated sites. The bill has yet to pass Congress, but if it does it could be a major boon for Nevada's casinos and the overall economy.

#  Delaware Becomes First State to Allow Sports Betting Online

Delaware became the first state in the United States to allow sports betting online on June 5, 2018. Governor John Carney signed the legislation into law, making Delaware the second state in the nation (after New Jersey) to offer legal sports betting.

The bill allows licensed casino operators in Delaware to offer both in-person and online sports betting. The state's three casinos -- Harrington Raceway and Casino, Dover Downs Hotel and Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack and Casino -- will be able to offer sports betting starting on Tuesday, October 30.

"Today is a great day for the First State," said Governor Carney. "This legislation not only creates hundreds of new jobs in our state but also allows us to participate in an industry that will generate new economic development opportunities."

Opponents of the bill had raised concerns about its impact on gambling addiction rates and its potential to negatively impact youth sports participation. However, supporters argued that legalizing sports betting would bring much-needed revenue to the state while helping to create new jobs.

Under the new law, bettors will be able to bet on professional and college football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, horse racing, and other sporting events. The minimum age for placing a bet is 21 years old.

#  California Follows Suit, Offers Online Gambling

On Tuesday, California officials announced that the state will offer online gambling in order to generate revenue for the cash-strapped government. This decision comes days after Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the nation to offer online gambling.

The pressure has been on for states to find new sources of revenue as the economy continues to sputter. The move towards online gambling is seen as a way to tap into a new and growing market.

So far, New Jersey, Nevada and Delaware have already launched online gambling programs. Pennsylvaniaâ€™s program went live on Monday and California is expected to launch its program in early 2015.

Licensing for online gambling will cost California casinos $22 million and operators will be required to pay 25% of their gross gaming revenue to the state. In addition, players will be required to be residents of California in order to participate in the program.

While there are some concerns that online gambling could lead to addiction or other problems, officials believe that the benefits outweigh the risks. They believe that the increased access to gambling will lead to more tax revenue and jobs for Californians.

#  New Jersey Moves Ahead with Plans for an Online Casino

The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement has given the go ahead for MGM Resorts to offer online casino games in the state. The first operator to launch an online casino in New Jersey is Borgata, which is a joint venture between MGM and Boyd Gaming.

The Borgata online casino will offer a full range of slots, table games, and poker variations. Players will be able to download the casino software or play games directly in their Web browser. In addition, the Borgata online casino will offer a loyalty program that awards players with points for their play. These points can be redeemed for cash, hotel rooms, and other gifts.

Other casinos that have received approval to offer online gaming in New Jersey include Caesars Entertainment, Tropicana Entertainment, and Trump Entertainment Resorts. These casinos are expected to launch their online casinos in the next few months.
