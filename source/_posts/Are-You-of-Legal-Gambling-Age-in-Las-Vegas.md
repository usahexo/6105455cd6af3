#  Are You of Legal Gambling Age in Las Vegas?

In the state of Nevada, you must be at least 21 years old to gamble. This is a requirement that is put in place to protect those who may not be of legal age from gambling and losing money they cannot afford to lose.

If you are caught gambling underage in Las Vegas, you could face consequences such as a fine or being banned from casinos. It is important to always be sure you are of legal gambling age before heading out to Las Vegas or any other casino city.

There are a few exceptions to the rule, such as the state’s 18-year-old drinking law which allows those 18 and older to consume alcohol. However, when it comes to gambling, those 18 and older are still considered minors.

So, if you’re planning on hitting up the slots or playing some Blackjack during your stay in Sin City, make sure you’re of legal gambling age first!

The legal age to gamble in Las Vegas is 21. This applies to all of Nevada, not just Sin City. The minimum age for other parts of the United States varies, but is usually 18.

The main reason for the gambling age limit being 21 is to protect those who are too young to make responsible decisions about their money. Most people at 18 or 21 aren’t considered adults yet and may not have the experience to know when to stop gambling or how much money they can afford to lose.

In addition, casinos want customers who are likely to spend money and be return customers. Many people younger than 21 either don’t have the money or aren’t interested in spending it on gambling. There are some exceptions, such as allowing 18 year olds to gamble in poker tournaments, but for the most part, the gambling age limit is 21.
