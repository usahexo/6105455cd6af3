#  Oklahoma Gambling Booms as Legalized Games Take Hold

Since gambling was legalized in Oklahoma in January 2018, the state has seen a surge in revenue from casino gaming and other forms of betting.

According to figures released by the Oklahoma Tax Commission, the state generated $47.8 million from gambling during the fiscal year that ended in June, up more than 36% from the prior fiscal year.

The biggest beneficiary has been tribal casinos, which saw their take from gambling jump by more than 50%, to $36.5 million. The amount generated by racetracks and lotteries also increased, while revenue from charitable bingo and keno fell.

Legalized gambling has been a controversial topic in Oklahoma for many years, but momentum has been shifting in recent years as other states have seen success with it.

Proponents of gambling argue that it is a source of much-needed revenue for the state, and that it can be regulated to prevent addiction and other negative consequences.

Opponents argue that gambling is a regressive tax that leads to social ills such as addiction and crime. They also question whether the state should be promoting addictive behavior.

Oklahoma is one of only a handful of states where casino gambling is legal. Most states have either outlawed casino gaming or left it up to the individual municipalities to decide whether to allow it.
