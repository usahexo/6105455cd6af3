#  PSG forward Neymar facing gambling addiction charges

Paris Saint-Germain forward Neymar is said to be facing gambling addiction charges, as confirmed by reports from Brazilian publication Globo Esporte. Neymar is being investigated for allegedly placing bets worth millions of dollars on football matches, with some of the wagers involving his own club.

The allegations against Neymar surfaced in March 2019, when Brazilian authorities began investigating a widespread corruption scheme related to illegal gambling. Neymar is not the only high-profile individual implicated in the scandal - other celebrities and athletes, including former Brazil striker Ronaldo, have also been named.

Neymar has denied any wrongdoing and issued a statement through his representatives stating that he is cooperating with investigators. However, the accusations are likely to damage the player's reputation and could lead to a suspension from football if he is found guilty.

This isn't the first time that Neymar has been in trouble with the law. In May 2018, he was fined $2 million by Brazilian authorities for tax evasion. In January 2019, he was banned from taking part in competitive matches for four months after he was found guilty of punching a fan following PSG's Coupe de France defeat by Rennes.

The ongoing gambling allegations add to the mounting off-field issues troubling Neymar and could potentially signal the end of his career at PSG. The French champions are thought to be growing increasingly frustrated with the 26-year-old's antics and there have been rumours of a rift between Neymar and head coach Thomas Tuchel.

It will be intriguing to see how Neymar's latest troubles affect his performances on the pitch for PSG and Brazil over the coming months.

#  Neymar confirms he is battling a gambling addiction

In a candid interview, Brazilian superstar Neymar has confirmed he is battling a gambling addiction. The 27-year old made the admission in an interview with Brazilian publication 'Globo Esporte', describing how he had begun to gamble from an early age and soon found himself unable to stop.

"It started when I was just starting out as a professional footballer and my family didn't have much money," Neymar said. "I would go to the casino with my friends and I would lose all my money. I got into it because I wanted to make more money."

The Barcelona forward described how his gambling addiction soon led him down a dark path, impacting both his personal and professional life.

"It was affecting my performances on the pitch and then my relationship with my family started to suffer too," Neymar said. "But the worst thing was that I wasn't winning anymore - I was losing all the time."

Neymar's confession comes in the wake of his disappointing World Cup campaign, which saw Brazil crash out in the semi-finals against eventual champions France. Some have speculated that Neymar's focus may have been elsewhere due to his personal struggles, although the player himself dismissed any such claims.

"It has nothing to do with that," Neymar said. "I'm not making any excuses - I simply wasn't good enough on the day."

Neymar has now vowed to seek professional help in order to overcome his gambling addiction and promises to make things right for both himself and Brazil.

"This is something that I need to fix," Neymar said. "I am not proud of what I have done but I know that I can change this by seeking help."

#  Neymar fined £8,000 after admitting to gambling addiction

 Brazilian football superstar Neymar has been fined £8,000 by a Paris court after admitting to gambling addiction. The 27-year-old was also ordered to attend a course on the risks of gambling.

Neymar's lawyer said that the player "recognises his errors" and is "committed to treating his addiction". The former Barcelona forward was charged with violating French betting regulations in January.

Gambling addiction is a serious problem that can have devastating consequences for individuals and their families. Neymar's admission should serve as a warning to others that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin.

If you or someone you know is suffering from a gambling addiction, please seek help immediately. There are many organisations that can provide support and advice, including GamCare and Gambling Anonymous.

#  PSG striker Neymar fined and warned over gambling addiction
 Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) striker Neymar has been fined and warned by the French football federation (FFF) over his gambling addiction.

Neymar has reportedly bet large sums of money on football matches, as well as other sports, and the FFF wants to make an example of the Brazilian in order to discourage others from doing the same.

In a statement, the FFF said: "Paris Saint-Germain player Neymar Jr has been warned about his future conduct and fined 20,000 euros for breaches of Article 14 of the regulations relating to match manipulation."

This is not the first time that Neymar has been in trouble for his gambling habits - he was banned for 14 games by Brazil's football federation in 2018 after being caught betting on games.

PSG will be hoping that this latest issue does not cause any distractions for Neymar ahead of their Champions League clash with Manchester United next week.

#  Neymar pledges to fight gambling addiction after being caught betting

Neymar has pledged to fight against his gambling addiction after being caught betting on football matches.

The Brazilian superstar, who plays for both Paris Saint-Germain and the Brazilian national team, was filmed placing a bet on a match between Deportivo La Coruna and Real Madrid.

Gambling is a major problem in Brazil, with an estimated 2 million people addicted to gambling. Neymar is one of the most high-profile athletes in Brazil and his admission that he has a gambling addiction will help to raise awareness of the issue.

In a post on social media, Neymar said: "I recognize that I have a problem with gambling and I want to apologize to my family, friends, teammates, fans and everyone who has always supported me."

He added: "I am committed to fighting this addiction and I urge everyone else who might have a problem with gambling to seek help."

Neymar is not the only high-profile athlete to be caught betting on football matches. Earlier this year, Lionel Messi was given a 21-month suspended prison sentence for tax fraud after being caught betting on Barcelona games.
