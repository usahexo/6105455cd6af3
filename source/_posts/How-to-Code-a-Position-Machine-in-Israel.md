#  How to Code a Position Machine in Israel

Israel is a small country in the Levant with about 8.5 million inhabitants, of which about 6 million are Jewish. It is bordered by Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan to the east, and Egypt to the southwest, with the Dead Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba lying to its west.

The official language of Israel is Hebrew. Arabic is also an official language, it being spoken by the Arab minority. English is commonly used as a second language.

Israel has one of the most technologically advanced economies in the world. The country has been described as a “startup nation”, due to its high number of technology startups relative to its population size. In 2013, Israel accounted for over 14 percent of all global hi-tech startup companies.

Israel has a GDP per capita of $36,700 (nominal) or $49,600 (PPP), making it one of the richest countries in the world. The average Israeli worker earns around $30 an hour.

In this article, we will learn how to code a position machine in Israel. We will use NodeJS and ExpressJS as our frameworks, and MongoDB as our database system.

First, we need to create a project folder and install our dependencies:

mkdir israel-position-machine cd israel-position-machine npm install --save express mongodb body-parser formidable qsjson morgan Helmet cors dotenv jsonwebtoken // ... more npm install's ...
1 2 3 4 5 mkdir israel - position - machine cd israel - position - machine npm install -- save express mongodb body - parser formidable qsjson morgan Helmet cors dotenv jsonwebtoken // ... more npm install ' s . . .

Next, let’s create our server file:

touch app.js 1 touch app . js

And add the following code:

var express = require('express'); var mongodb = require('mongodb'); var bodyParser = require('body-parser'); var qs = require('qs'); var morgan = require('morgan'); var helmet = require('helmet'); var cors = require('cors'); var dotenv = require('dotenv'); var jsonwebtoken = require('jsonwebtoken'); // Configuration parameters const dbURI = 'mongodb://localhost:27017/israel_position_machine'; const port = 3000; const encryptedTokenSecret = 'gI6OMxWfjvhcwTEdZgfoaf8YKyWyfujKYucx2lrKQo='; // Create Express application const app = express(); … 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 120 121 122 123 124 125 126 127 128 129 130 131 132 133 134 135 136 137 138 139 140 141 142 143 144 145 146 147 148 149 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162 163 164 165 166 167 168 169 170 171 172 173 174 175 176 177 178 179 180 181 182 183 184 185 186 187 188 189 190 191 192 193 194 195 196 197 198 199 200 201 202 203 204 205 206 207 208 209 210 211 212 213 214 215 216 217 218 219 220 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 228 229 230 231 232 233 234 235 236 237 238 239 240 241 242 243 244 245 246 247 248 249 250 251 252 253 254 255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304 305 306 307 308 309 310 311 312 313 314 315 316 317 318 319 320 321 322 323 324 325 326 327 328 329 330 331 332 333 334 335 336 337 338 339 340 341 342 343 344 345 346 347 348 349 350 351 352 353 354 355 356 357 358 359 360 361 362 363 364 365 366 367 368 369 370 371 372 373 374 375 376 377 378 379 380 381 382 383 384 385 386 387 388 389 390 391 392 393 394 395 396 397 398 399 400 401 402 403 404 405 406 407 408 409 410 411 412 413 414 415 416 417 418 419 420 421 422 423 424

#  How to Code a Position machine in less than an hour

In this article, we are going to learn how to create a position machine in less than an hour. We will be using the following:

Python

Numpy

Matplotlib

Let's get started!

First, we import the necessary modules:

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Next, we define a function that takes two inputs - x and y - and calculates the position of the point (x, y) on the graph:


 def position(x, y):     dx = x - 0.5 dy = y - 0.5    return np.sqrt(dx*dx + dy*dy)


Now let's create a simple function to plot a graph:

def plot_graph(x, y):  ax = plt.subplot(211) # Set up the axes ax.plot(x, y) # Plot the points ax.grid() # Add a grid for reference plt.show()

 We can now use this function to plot our graphs:

 x = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.1) # Create an array of numbers y = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.1) # Create an array of numbers graph_1 = plot_graph(x, y) plt.savefig("Graph 1.png")

We can also add labels and titles to our graphs:

 x = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.1) # Create an array of numbers y = np.arange(-2, 2, 0.1) # Create an array of numbers graph_2 = plot_graph(x, y) plt.title("Position vs Time") plt.xticks(rotate=True) plt.yticks([]) plt.show()

 Finally, let's code our position machine! We'll use a while loop to keep track of the position of the point (x0, y0):



def position_machine(x0, y0):  while True:    x = x0 + dx y = y0 + dy   position = position(x,y) # Use our function to calculate the position if position > 1000: # Check if our point is outside of the range break # Break out of the loop else: print("position : ",position) # Print out the current position x0 += dx # Increment our x coordinate by dx dy += dy # Increment our y coordinate by dy

#  How to Code a Position machine that wins every time

In this article, we are going to learn how to code a position machine that can win every time. This is an important skill for any aspiring poker player as it can give you a clear edge over your opponents.

There are a few different ways to go about coding a position machine, and we will explore two of them in this article. The first method involves using basic arithmetic to calculate the odds of winning given the current board and player’s hands. The second method uses a more sophisticated technique called Monte Carlo simulation.

We will start with the basic arithmetic method. The idea behind this approach is that we can calculate the odds of our opponent having a better hand than ours, based on the current board and our hand. We can then use these odds to determine whether or not it is profitable to call or fold.

The first step is to determine our opponent’s range. We can do this by assigning probabilities to each possible hand that our opponent could have. For example, if we are playing against a weak player, their range might only include hands such as pairs of 7s or lower, Aces or Kings, and suited connectors like J-T-9-8.

Once we know our opponent’s range, we need to calculate the probability of them having a better hand than ours. This is done by multiplying the number of cards in our opponent’s range that are stronger than our hand (e.g., if we are holding A-J and our opponent has K-Q, there are four cards in their range that are stronger than ours) by the probability of each of those cards being drawn.

We can then subtract this number from 1 to get the probability that our opponent has a better hand than ours. For example, if there are four cards in our opponent’s range that are stronger than ours and the probability of each of those cards being drawn is 25%, then 1 – (4 × 0.25) = 0.75, meaning there is a 75% chance that our opponent has a better hand than us.

Now that we have determined the probability that our opponent has a better hand than ours, we need to decide what action to take based on this information. If the probability is high enough (e.g., above 85%), then it is usually profitable to fold; otherwise, we should call. Table 1 shows some example calculations for various hands and probabilities:





















      Hand Probability Fold? Call? A-K vs K-Q 85% Yes No A-7 vs K-J 95% Yes No 3-2 vs 2-1 60% Yes No 6-5 vs 3-2 75% Yes No 9-8 vs 5-4 80% Yes No J-10 vs 7-6 85% Yes No 

As you can see from Table 1, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to deciding whether or not to call or fold; it depends on the specific situation involved. However, using this approach will give you a good starting point for making these types of decisions.

Now let’s move on to the Monte Carlo simulation approach. This approach relies on simulating many different scenarios in order to get an accurate estimate of the chances of winning given a particular board and player’s hands. This approach tends to be more accurate than simply using basic arithmetic, but it also requires more computational resources (e.g., time and memory).

To get started with Monte Carlo simulation, we first need to define some variables:

board – The current board state (e.g., {A♠ Q♥}).player_1 – Our position at the beginning of the turn (e.g., UTG).player_2 – The position of our opponent at the beginning of the turn (e .g . , MP).hand_1 – Our hand at the beginningoftheturn (e .g . , {A♠ Q♥}).hand_2 – Our opponentshand at the beginningoftheturn(e .g . , {A♦ 10♥}).profit – Whether or not calling results in profit for us (e .g., True/False).outcome – The outcome ofthehand(eitherwin/lose/draw).card_count_1 – The number offcards inthehand_1(e .g . , 4).card_count_2 – The number offcards inthehand_2(e .g . , 5).Next,we needtoinitialize some random values into these variables:random_board = [{A♠ Q♥},{8♦ 7♥},{3♦ 2♣}]random_player1 = {UTG : 40%, MP : 30%, CO :

#  How to make a position machine that never loses

A position machine is a type of gambling device that is designed to make a profit for the operator no matter what the outcome of the game. In this article, we will show you how to make a position machine that never loses, using basic probability mathematics.

The concept behind a position machine is simple. We are going to use a random number generator to generate two numbers, A and B. If A is larger than B, we will bet on black at an even money payout. If B is larger than A, we will bet on red at an even money payout. Regardless of the colour of the ball, we will always make a profit of $1 on every bet we make.

To start with, let's define some variables:

n = The number of trials we want to play

P = The probability of black occurring

Q = The probability of red occurring


Now, if we want to make a profit of $1 on every bet we make, then P * (1 - Q) must be equal to 1. This can be rearranged to give us:
P + Q = 1
This equation can be used to determine the probabilities for black and red given any value for n. For example, if we want to find the probabilities for n = 100, then:
P = (100 / (100 + 1)) * 0.5 = 50% 
Q = (100 / (100 + 1)) * 0.5 = 50%

#  How to code your own position machine

In this article, we will be discussing how to code your own position machine. This is a very simple machine that takes in a number and outputs the corresponding position on a 4x4 grid. We will be using the Python programming language for this tutorial.

Step 1: Creating the function

The first step is to create the function that will take in a number and output the position on the grid. We will be calling this function get_pos(). This function will need four parameters: the number we are trying to find the position for, x_position, y_position, and orientation. The x_position and y_position parameters will be used to calculate the coordinates of the position on the grid, while the orientation parameter will tell us which way around the grid we are looking (either clockwise or counterclockwise). Here is our function:

def get_pos(number, x_position, y_position, orientation): 

If orientation is "clockwise": 
 return (x_position + number % 4, y_position + number / 4) 
 elif orientation is "counterclockwise": 
 return (x_position - number % 4, y_position - number / 4)


def get_pos(number, x_position, y_position, orientation): 
 if orientation == "clockwise": 
 return (x_position + int(number % 4), y_position + int(number / 4)) 
 elif orientation == "counterclockwise": 
 return (x_position - int(number % 4), y_position - int(number / 4))

 Step 2: Putting it all togetherNow that we have created our function, we need to put it all together in a program. We will start by importing the necessary libraries: random and math. We will also create two variables called grid and currentPosition. The grid variable will hold our map of the 4x4 grid, while currentPosition will keep track of our current position on the grid. Here is our code: import random import math

grid = [] currentPosition = 0

Next, we need to write our main() function. This function will take two input parameters: number and direction. The number parameter will be used to determine which square on the grid we want to find the position for, while direction will be either "clockwise" or "counterclockwise". We will then use our getPos() function to find the position for that square on the grid and print it out. Here is our code: def main(): 
number = int(input("Enter a number :")) direction = input("Enter direction :") 
print("The position for {} is {}".format(number, getPos(number, direction))) main() Run your program now and enter some numbers! You should see output like this: Enter a number : 3 Enter direction : clockwise The position for 3 is (1, 2)
