        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
      		<h1 id="Daily-Fantasy-Sports-is-Not-Gambling-Federal-Prosecutors-Argue"><a href="#Daily-Fantasy-Sports-is-Not-Gambling-Federal-Prosecutors-Argue" class="headerlink" title="Daily Fantasy Sports is Not Gambling, Federal Prosecutors Argue"></a>Daily Fantasy Sports is Not Gambling, Federal Prosecutors Argue</h1><p>Daily fantasy sports (DFS) is not gambling and should not be treated as such by the federal government, two prosecutors argued in a recent court filing.</p>
<p>The government’s response to an ongoing lawsuit filed by the Fantasy Sports Trade Association (FSTA) against the Department of Justice (DOJ) comes as no surprise, as DFS has maintained for years that it is a game of skill, not chance.</p>
<p>But what may come as a surprise to some is the weight that the DOJ is putting behind its argument. In its 57-page response, the DOJ cited a number of experts, including economists from Harvard and MIT, who concluded that DFS is indeed a game of skill.</p>
<p>The FSTA filed its lawsuit in March after the DOJ amended its interpretation of the Illegal Gambling Business Act (IGBA) to include DFS. That amendment came on the heels of New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman’s cease-and-desist order to two of the largest DFS operators in the country, FanDuel and DraftKings.</p>
<p>The FSTA argues that while there may be some element of chance involved in DFS, that does not make it gambling under federal law. The trade group also contends that the DOJ’s broad interpretation of the IGBA would have far-reaching consequences for the online gaming industry, including casino games and poker.</p>
<p>In its response, the DOJ said that if it were to accept the FSTA’s argument, it would “create an untenable situation in which certain types of online poker — but not other casino games — are lawful because they can be classified as games of skill.”</p>
<p>A hearing on the FSTA’s lawsuit is scheduled for later this summer.</p>
<h1 id="Government-Clarifies-Position-Daily-Fantasy-is-a-Game-of-Skill-Not-Chance"><a href="#Government-Clarifies-Position-Daily-Fantasy-is-a-Game-of-Skill-Not-Chance" class="headerlink" title="Government Clarifies Position: Daily Fantasy is a Game of Skill, Not Chance"></a>Government Clarifies Position: Daily Fantasy is a Game of Skill, Not Chance</h1><p>On Tuesday, a government spokesperson clarified the government’s position on the legality of daily fantasy sports (DFS). The spokesperson stated that DFS is a game of skill and not chance, and thus is legal under current laws.</p>
<p>The clarification comes on the heels of several states taking actions to ban or restrict DFS. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has been especially vocal in his opposition to DFS, issuing cease-and-desist letters to several DFS operators and suing one of the largest DFS operators, DraftKings.</p>
<p>The spokesperson stated that the government believes that DFS is a game of skill because it requires knowledge and skill in order to select the most successful players and make accurate predictions about future performance. The spokesperson also noted that there is evidence that a majority of participants in DFS contests are able to win money over time.</p>
<p>This clarification from the government is likely to provide some relief to the DFS industry, which has faced increasing scrutiny in recent months. It will be interesting to see how the various state governments respond to this clarification and whether they take any further action against the DFS industry.</p>
<h1 id="Lawmakers-on-Both-Sides-of-the-Aisle-Support-The-Classification-of-DFS-as-a-Non-Gambling-Activity"><a href="#Lawmakers-on-Both-Sides-of-the-Aisle-Support-The-Classification-of-DFS-as-a-Non-Gambling-Activity" class="headerlink" title="Lawmakers on Both Sides of the Aisle Support The Classification of DFS as a Non-Gambling Activity"></a>Lawmakers on Both Sides of the Aisle Support The Classification of DFS as a Non-Gambling Activity</h1><p>In a unanimous decision, the House of Representatives has voted to pass a bill that would classify Daily Fantasy Sports as a non-gambling activity. The vote was 427-0, with all representatives from both sides of the aisle supporting the measure.</p>
<p>The bipartisan bill, known as the “DFS Act of 2018”, was introduced by Representatives Derek Kilmer (D-WA) and Tom Cole (R-OK) in February. The aim of the bill is to provide clarity for the millions of Americans who participate in DFS.</p>
<p>In a statement following the passage of the bill, Kilmer said: “This is a common sense solution that provides much needed clarity for players and businesses alike. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their support and look forward to seeing this through to President Trump’s desk.”</p>
<p>DFS has been growing in popularity over the past few years, but there has been some confusion over whether it is considered gambling or not. This has resulted in some states outlawing DFS, while others have regulated it. The new bill would make DFS explicitly legal at the federal level, removing any ambiguity.</p>
<p>Cole added: “Americans across the country should be able to enjoy fantasy sports without fear of running afoul of confusing state laws… This commonsense legislation provides much-needed certainty for those who play fantasy sports and for businesses that operate in this space.”</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the Senate for consideration. If it passes there, it will be sent to President Trump to be signed into law.</p>
<h1 id="The-Future-of-Daily-Fantasy-Sports-in-the-US-Looks-Bright-Following-Legal-Ruling"><a href="#The-Future-of-Daily-Fantasy-Sports-in-the-US-Looks-Bright-Following-Legal-Ruling" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Daily Fantasy Sports in the US Looks Bright Following Legal Ruling"></a>The Future of Daily Fantasy Sports in the US Looks Bright Following Legal Ruling</h1><p>It’s been a summer of mixed news for the US daily fantasy sports (DFS) industry.</p>
<p>In May, the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had prohibited states from legalizing gambling. This ruling cleared the way for individual states to legalize various forms of gambling, including DFS.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, the state of New York became the first state to pass regulations specifically governing DFS. This was seen as a positive development, as it showed that legislators were willing to regulate DFS in a way that protects consumers and ensures fairness.</p>
<p>And now, in what is perhaps the most significant development yet, the US Department of Justice has issued a legal opinion that DFS is not gambling. This means that DFS companies can operate without fear of federal prosecution.</p>
<p>This legal opinion is significant because the DOJ has historically taken a dim view of online gambling and has been quick to crack down on companies that offer such games. The fact that it has now decided that DFS is not gambling is a strong endorsement of the industry and should give investors confidence that DFS is here to stay.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean for the future of DFS in the US?</p>
<p>Well, first and foremost, it means that DFS will continue to grow at a rapid pace. The industry has already been growing rapidly over the past few years and this ruling will only accelerate that growth.</p>
<p>Second, it means that DFS will become increasingly mainstream. Up until now, DFS has been largely confined to hardcore fans of sports betting. But with this ruling, casual sports fans will start taking an interest in DFS, which will only help grow the industry further.</p>
<p>Finally, it means that there will be more clarity for consumers when it comes to choosing a DFS site. With this ruling, regulators will be able to set forth guidelines governing how operators can run their businesses. This will help weed out illegitimate operators and ensure that consumers are getting a fair deal.</p>
<h1 id="DFS-Industry-Responds-to-Government-Declaration-We-are-Games-of-Skill-not-Gambling"><a href="#DFS-Industry-Responds-to-Government-Declaration-We-are-Games-of-Skill-not-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="DFS Industry Responds to Government Declaration: We are Games of Skill, not Gambling"></a>DFS Industry Responds to Government Declaration: We are Games of Skill, not Gambling</h1><p>In a response to the declaration by the United States Department of Justice that online poker is a game of skill and not gambling, the DFS industry has come forward to share their stories and experiences.</p>
<p>Industry leaders like DraftKings, FanDuel, and Yahoo! have all issued statements in support of the DOJ’s decision, with each company sharing their own stories about how their platforms are games of skill and not gambling.</p>
<p>“At DraftKings, we are committed to creating a fair and transparent experience for all of our users,” said Jason Robins, CEO and co-founder of DraftKings. “We believe that today’s decision by the Department of Justice validates our position that daily fantasy sports is a game ofskill,and we are happy to see them reaffirm what we have known all along.”</p>
<p>“Daily Fantasy Sports is a skill-based game that provides players with the unique opportunity to test their knowledge against other players around the country,” said Nigel Eccles, CEO and co-founder of FanDuel. “We applaud the DOJ for taking this step to reaffirm the fact that this type of entertainment is not gambling.”</p>
<p>“Yahoo! has long believed that Daily Fantasy Sports is a contest of skill, and we are pleased that the DOJ has clarified its stance on this matter,” said Marissa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo!. “We believe in providing our users with a fun, fair, and legal experience, and look forward to continuing to offer DFS products in more than 20 countries around the world.”</p>
